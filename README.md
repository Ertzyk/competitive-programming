# 🧠 Competitive Programming Solutions  
This repository contains my solutions to competitive programming problems — primarily from Codeforces, with some from CSES and the contest "Potyczki Algorytmiczne."  
It's a personal archive to track my progress and showcase problem-solving skills. Not meant as tutorials — just a portfolio of solved problems.
